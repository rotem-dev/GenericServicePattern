# GenericServicePattern
A clean reusable generic service

This pattern should be used for integrations against 3rd party services. SMS providers, Email, Travel and so on...

Basic explainations:
Amadues and Yaya are "providers" which provide the service of GetCar and FixCar.
This is not a real implementation but only a basic structure which I try to enhance.
